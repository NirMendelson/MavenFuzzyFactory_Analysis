# MavenFuzzyFactory Analysis
## Business problem
The CEO has requested a thorough analysis of the sales data from the holiday season last year (November-December of 2014) to provide recommendations on how to boost sales in the upcoming holiday season. The focus is primarily on increasing the conversion rate while also uncovering additional valuable insights that can contribute to increased sales.
