# MavenFuzzyFactory Analysis
## Business problem
The CEO has requested a thorough analysis of the sales data from the holiday season last year (November-December of 2014) to provide recommendations on how to boost sales in the upcoming holiday season. The focus is primarily on increasing the conversion rate while also uncovering additional valuable insights that can contribute to increased sales.

## The Database
The database contains Maven Fuzzy Factory's sales data for their stuffed animal toys from March 2012 to March 2015. The company offers four products, namely:
1.	The Original Mr. Fuzzy (launched on the 19.03.2012)
2.	The Forever Love Bear (launched on the 06.01.2013)
3.	The Birthday Sugar Panda (launched on the 12.12.2013)
4.	The Hudson River Mini Bear (launched on the 05.02.2014)
The company exclusively sells these products through their website. The database comprises six tables: order_item_refund, order_item, orders, products, website_pageviews, and website_sessions.

## Data Analysis
Let's begin by examining the key metrics from last November-December, including the number of website sessions, number of orders, and conversion rate, while comparing them with previous months.

Next, we'll delve deeper into factors affecting the conversion rate and identify insights that can help increase it.

### UTM Source
Maven Fuzzy Factory uses five different UTM sources to track their website traffic:
1.	Organic search
2.	Brand ads on search engines
3.	Nonbrand ads on search engines
4.	Direct type-in
5.	Social media ads

We'll analyze the conversion rate for each UTM source and determine which ones perform the best.

Insights on UTM Sources:
•	It's predicted that 'organic search,' 'brand ads,' and 'direct type-in' will have a high conversion rate since customers actively enter the website during these interactions.

•	Most orders come from nonbrand ads, which target customers unfamiliar with our company.

•	social media ads has the lowest convertion rate, and the company pays 1$ per sessions, lets see is it worth to keep paying

•	Social media ads have the lowest conversion rate.

We need to examine the key metrics from the social media ads

![Sessions, Orders and Conversion Rate](/Pictures/Social_Media_Ads_Metrics.png)

The social media ads have resulted in bringing 5,316 users to our website, and out of them, 736 have returned for more visits. The total margin from sales generated by these users amounts to $12,948. However, it's essential to consider the $2 cost incurred by the company for each session generated through the social media ads. Now, we need to determine if this investment is profitable and if it makes sense to continue with these ads.

Social media ads were launched in August 2014, and during that initial month, we incurred losses. However, since then, the ads have consistently generated profits each month. Since the launch, the cumulative profit stands at $2315. Based on this positive performance, I recommend continuing with the ads.

Let's revisit the UTM sources. A significant portion of our orders comes from nonbrand ads. Now, let's delve deeper into this aspect. We have nonbrand ads on both Bsearch and Gsearch. We'll analyze and compare their conversion rates to identify which one performs the best.
